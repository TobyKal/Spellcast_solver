# Spellcast Solver 🧙‍♂️🔮

Welcome to the "Spellcast Solver". This is the place where magic happens. And by magic, I mean a Discord bot that spits out high-scoring words for a board game.

## What is This Sorcery? 🤨

This repository is home to a terminal application and its more sociable sibling, a Discord bot. The bot's sole purpose in its digital life is to give you the highest-scoring words from your favorite board game.

## The Journey 🛤️

- **The Genesis**: It all started with a dream. A dream to create something that would earn me the Developer Badge on Discord. Yes, that's right. This project was born out of a desire for virtual validation. 🏅
- **The Process**: Turns out, making a bot isn't rocket science. This project taught me a ton about Python, but not enough to use classes 🐍
- **The Struggle**: Some parts were harder than others. Like figuring out how to search for words. 🪄
- **The Evolution**: I've opened this repo more times than I've opened my fridge. Each time, I've rewritten the spaghetti code into... slightly better spaghetti code. 🍝

## Disclaimer 🚨

I think it should still work. I don't remember how much code i deleted before abandoning it.

## Final Words 📜

If you find this bot useful, great! If not, well, it is what it is 😎
